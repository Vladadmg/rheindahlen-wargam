                    <span class="fliesstext">What can one say about this event? 
                    What superlatives can we employ? <br>
                    The event seems to attract more and more new talent as well 
                    as acting as a spur to those who regularly attend. In Europe 
                    we all have to travel long distance but mention should be 
                    made of Arrigo who flew in from Bologna and Ki and his friend 
                    from Switzerland.<br>
                    The centre piece was a massive 5 by 3 metre recreation of 
                    the Battle of the Little Bighorn for a 15mm scale battle. 
                    The cavalry battalions of Reno and Custer were at a one for 
                    one scale. However this mattered not as they still did not 
                    win! Not once! Well done to the Rheindahlen club for all their 
                    efforts and to Huw for painting god knows how many hundreds 
                    of figures for the battle. <br>
                    Only a little smaller in size was a WWII recreation by <b>Charles 
                    and Dougie</b> in 1/48th scale. One of the new gaming areas 
                    to Action was <b>Games Workshop</b> with their Pirates which 
                    kept the boy population of Rheindahlen amused each day. Their 
                    (GW) painting techniques were also studied very attentively 
                    by most of the adults.<br>
                    One of the more unusual games was a Vietnam recreation by<b> 
                    Pete Garnham</b> from the Apocalypse Now film. It was based 
                    on the surfing scene and was entitled Charlie Don&#146;t Surf. 
                    It was accurately portrayed as Pete must have spent hours 
                    looking at the film frame by frame. It also used up most of 
                    the plastic flower arrangements found in Xenos. A good game 
                    and visually very attractive.<br>
                    Our traders were most supportive as they have been in recent 
                    years. One of the newer traders was<b> Richard and Zo&euml; 
                    from Magister Militum</b> and they seemed to have enjoyed 
                    themselves. <b>SHQ</b> came over from the UK and with Herr 
                    Hoffman and Mark Brown formed a massive mini mall at one end 
                    of the hall. We finally managed to increase our Mayhem range 
                    of ruined WWII buildings! Hopefully next year Herr Hoffman 
                    will bring along some of the Waterloo diorama he has put together. 
                    I have seen the photos and they look impressive. Or maybe 
                    we will go for the Gettysburg Diorama, another impressive 
                    piece of work which many people have contributed to.<br>
                    We also had a first in that Card games were in evidence from 
                    <b>Arne</b> and his Warlord Saga. Will this be even bigger 
                    next year?<br>
                    I have only mentioned a few names and a few games but this 
                    event would not be anything without the support and goodwill 
                    from all the people who do attend and in their own small way 
                    contribute to the success and continuation of Action. Next 
                    year is my last one as an organiser after that I shall have 
                    retired to the hills of Normandy to start my own Wargames 
                    club. I obviously want next year to be the biggest and the 
                    best we can present. I want lots of different games and themes, 
                    lots of people enjoying themselves and some really nice, mouth 
                    wateringly scenic presentations. Which brings me to mention 
                    one of our local traders, <b>Didier</b>, did you see his Lord 
                    of the Rings models? What quality!<br>
                    Yes the standards are rising and in so many pleasant ways. 
                    Keep up the good work friends and let us see you all again 
                    next year.<br>
                    <br>
                    Regards to all<br>
                    Vic</span></p>
